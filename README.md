# ArrowVLM

Train `Qwen3-VL` to detect arrows in scientific figures and output structured grounding results with:

- one `bbox_2d` per arrow
- one ordered `keypoints_2d` chain per arrow

This branch is the `protocol-v2` refactor. It moves the project closer to the official `Qwen3-VL` grounding usage pattern:

- use standard chat-style `user` prompts
- keep coordinates as normalized integers in `[0, 999]`
- output plain JSON instead of a custom special-token DSL
- do not extend the tokenizer with task-specific protocol tokens

## Task Format

Each prediction is a JSON array. Every item must be:

```json
{
  "label": "single_arrow",
  "bbox_2d": [123, 456, 789, 900],
  "keypoints_2d": [
    [130, 470],
    [188, 471],
    [270, 590]
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- all coordinates are normalized integers in `[0, 999]`
- `label` must be `single_arrow` or `double_arrow`
- `bbox_2d` uses `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`
- for `single_arrow`, `keypoints_2d` are ordered from **tail to head**
- for `single_arrow`, `keypoints_2d[0]` is the arrow tail point on the centerline
- for `single_arrow`, `keypoints_2d[-1]` is the arrow head tip on the centerline
- for `double_arrow`, `keypoints_2d[0]` and `keypoints_2d[-1]` are the two head tips
- for `double_arrow`, the stored order starts from the upper-left head and ends at the other head; if `x` ties, smaller `y` comes first
- for polyline / curve arrows, intermediate keypoints are path control points rather than arrow-head corner points
- each point is `[x, y]`
- each arrow must contain at least `2` points

At training and evaluation time, coordinates are mapped between:

- normalized integer grid `[0, 999]`
- original image pixel coordinates

The model trains against the JSON text directly.

## Why This Version

Earlier versions of this project used a custom protocol with many task-specific special tokens such as:

- begin/end markers
- `x/y` coordinate tokens
- explicit point-list delimiters

That formulation was harder to train and drifted away from the official `Qwen3-VL` grounding style. This branch reduces that mismatch by:

- keeping the output machine-readable
- retaining keypoints
- avoiding new protocol token embeddings
- staying closer to the model’s native text-generation distribution

## Repository Layout

```text
configs/              training configs
scripts/              preparation, training, inference, and utility entrypoints
src/vlm_structgen/          core package
data/                 raw and processed datasets
models/               local model weights
```

## Environment

This repository is designed around:

- Python `3.11`
- `uv`
- CUDA-enabled PyTorch when training on GPU

Create the environment:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

If you want explicit CUDA wheels:

```bash
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
uv pip install -e . --no-deps
```

If you also want the optional FlashAttention dependency:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[gpu]"
```

## Data Preparation

Raw LabelMe-style annotations can be converted into normalized JSONL files with:

```bash
python scripts/arrow/prepare_data.py \
  --raw-json-dir data/raw/json \
  --image-dir data/raw/figure \
  --output-dir data/processed
```

This produces:

```text
data/processed/train.jsonl
data/processed/val.jsonl
data/processed/reports/data_cleaning_report.json
data/processed/reports/split_manifest.json
```

Each record stores:

- image path
- image width / height
- per-arrow label
- per-arrow bbox
- per-arrow ordered keypoints

Before writing each sample to JSONL, the pipeline canonicalizes the in-image
instance order to keep training targets deterministic. The sort key is:

- `(y1, x1, y2, x2, y_tail, x_tail, y_head, x_head, n_points)`
- where `bbox = [x1, y1, x2, y2]`
- in practice this means instances are written top-to-bottom first, then
  left-to-right, with endpoint coordinates and point count used only as
  tie-breakers

Keypoint semantics are fixed across current datasets:

- `single_arrow`: first keypoint = tail point, last keypoint = head tip
- `double_arrow`: first keypoint and last keypoint = the two head tips
- `double_arrow`: point order is normalized so the upper-left head comes first before writing JSONL
- intermediate keypoints = path control points

For real LabelMe data, rectangle classes are mapped as:

- `c0~c3` -> `single_arrow`
- `c4~c7` -> `double_arrow`

The JSONL records are then encoded into the normalized JSON grounding target during dataset loading.

## Two-Stage Data Preparation

Two-stage experiments derive two datasets from the processed annotations:

- `stage1`: mixed full-image + tile supervision
  - original full-image samples
  - ratio-based multi-scale sliding-window samples
  - density-driven crop samples
  - grounding target: `label + bbox`
  - weighted token loss uses precise `GroundingCodec` field spans for label text and bbox coordinates
  - prompt style aligned with the Qwen3-VL grounding cookbook: short instruction + relative coordinates
- `stage2`: target-conditioned crop supervision
  - crop image
  - main-arrow keypoint skeleton target
  - target format: `{"keypoints_2d":[[x0,y0],[x1,y1],...]}`

Prepare Stage1:

```bash
python scripts/arrow/prepare_stage1_data.py \
  --input-dir data/processed \
  --output-dir data/two_stage \
  --num-workers 8 \
  --stage1-include-full-image \
  --stage1-tile-size-ratios 0.35,0.5 \
  --stage1-min-tile-size 512 \
  --stage1-max-tile-size 1280 \
  --stage1-density-min-instances 5 \
  --stage1-density-max-instances 30 \
  --stage1-dedup-iou-threshold 0.9
```

Prepare Stage2:

```bash
python scripts/arrow/prepare_stage2_data.py \
  --input-dir data/processed \
  --output-dir data/two_stage \
  --padding-ratio 0.3 \
  --num-workers 8 \
  --stage2-aug-ratio 0.0
```

This writes:

```text
data/two_stage/
  stage1/
    train.jsonl
    val.jsonl
  stage2/
    train.jsonl
    val.jsonl
    images/
      train/
      val/
  reports/
    prepare_stage1_report.json
    prepare_stage2_report.json
```

Stage1 tile sizing is now ratio-driven:

- crop sizes are resolved from image short-side ratios
- `stage1_min_tile_size` / `stage1_max_tile_size` clamp the resolved pixel size
- an instance is kept in a tile only when its bbox is fully enclosed by that tile
- any tile that partially intersects a bbox is discarded instead of becoming a training sample
- near-duplicate crops with the same instance set are removed using `stage1_dedup_iou_threshold`

Stage 2 uses crop-local coordinates. For every target instance:

- the crop is centered on the target bbox
- default padding ratio is `0.3`
- out-of-bound crop area is padded with black pixels
- training targets are reprojected into the crop-local `[0,999]` coordinate system
- stage2 JSONL stores structured `condition` fields, and the current prompt explicitly injects crop-local `label + bbox_2d`
- stage2 target text is a JSON object: `{"keypoints_2d":[[x0,y0],[x1,y1],...]}`
- stage2 does not add noisy hint samples by default; set `--stage2-aug-ratio 0.3` if you want about 30% of train instances to receive one extra noisy sample
- stage2 noisy augmentation only jitters the bbox crop condition; there is no endpoint jitter in the current formulation
- current stage2 jitter defaults are conservative:
  - `bbox_center_jitter_ratio = 0.03`
  - `bbox_scale_jitter_ratio = 0.05`

## Training

### Single-GPU LoRA

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config configs/train/train_lora.yaml
```

Add a run id to make the output directory and W&B run traceable:

```bash
python scripts/train.py \
  --config configs/train/train_lora.yaml \
  --run-id 20260325-exp01
```

The training config automatically appends the model scale tag inferred from
`model_name_or_path` / `remote_model_name_or_path`. For example, a 2B model
will use names and output paths ending in `2b`, while 4B / 8B configs will be
separated automatically.

Override the vision-tower freezing behavior for one run:

```bash
python scripts/train.py \
  --config configs/train/train_full_ft.yaml \
  --run-id 20260325-exp01 \
  --freeze-vision-tower false
```

Gradient checkpointing is enabled by default. Override it explicitly if you want to turn it off:

```bash
python scripts/train.py \
  --config configs/train/train_full_ft.yaml \
  --run-id 20260325-exp01 \
  --gradient-checkpointing false
```

### Single-GPU Full Fine-Tuning

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config configs/train/train_full_ft.yaml
```

### Multi-GPU

LoRA:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 scripts/train.py --config configs/train/train_lora.yaml
```

Full FT:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 scripts/train.py --config configs/train/train_full_ft.yaml
```

### Stage-2 SFT From An Earlier Checkpoint

Use `--init-from` when you want to start a fresh training stage from earlier
weights without restoring optimizer, scheduler, RNG, or global step:

```bash
python scripts/train.py \
  --config configs/train/train_full_ft.yaml \
  --init-from outputs/qwen3vl-post/2b/checkpoints/best
```

Use `--resume-from` only when you want to continue the same interrupted run.

### Two-Stage LoRA Training

Stage 1, 2B:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config configs/train/train_stage1_lora.yaml
```

Stage 1, 4B:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config configs/train/train_stage1_lora_4b.yaml
```

Stage 2, 2B:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config configs/train/train_stage2_lora.yaml
```

Stage 2, 4B:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config configs/train/train_stage2_lora_4b.yaml
```

Stage 2 records carry structured `condition` fields and structured ground truth.
`target_text` is generated from the structured GT at dataset load time via the
task adapter / codec, rather than stored as data truth in JSONL. The final user
prompt is rendered at training time from
`prompt.user_prompt_template`, so the normal `scripts/train.py` entrypoint can
still be reused without baking full prompt strings into every sample.

### LoRA Target Groups

LoRA configs now split target modules into three groups:

- `lang_target_modules`: language tower LoRA targets such as
  `q_proj/k_proj/v_proj/o_proj/gate_proj/up_proj/down_proj`
- `vis_target_modules`: visual tower LoRA targets such as
  `attn.qkv/attn.proj/mlp.linear_fc1/mlp.linear_fc2`
- `proj_target_modules`: projector LoRA targets; an empty list means "all
  linear layers matched by `projector_name_substrings`"

Behavior:

- `freeze_vision_tower: true`: no visual-tower LoRA is attached
- `freeze_vision_tower: false`: visual-tower LoRA is attached on
  `vis_target_modules`
- `train_projector: true` in LoRA mode: projector LoRA is attached on
  `proj_target_modules`, rather than fully unfreezing projector weights

## Auxiliary Tools

Inference, evaluation, and demo scripts are auxiliary workflows and are maintained in dedicated docs instead of this main README.

- 辅助脚本文档: [docs/tool_scripts.md](docs/tool_scripts.md)

This guide includes:

- one-stage inference CLI
- two-stage inference CLI
- one-stage and two-stage demos
- stage1 grounding replayable evaluation (`eval_stage1_grounding.py`)

## Prompting Style

This branch keeps the `system_prompt` interface, but the default configuration follows the official `Qwen3-VL` style:

- no custom system prompt by default
- the task instruction lives in the `user` message together with the image

The default prompt asks the model to:

- output only a JSON array
- avoid markdown and extra text
- use normalized integer coordinates in `[0, 999]`
- emit `single_arrow` / `double_arrow` labels explicitly
- keep `single_arrow` keypoints ordered from tail to head

Training configuration is separate: `scripts/train.py` still only reads training YAML files.

## Important Notes

- images are not fed at raw native resolution without control
- the processor uses bounded dynamic resizing with `min_pixels` / `max_pixels`
- decoder-only batch generation must use left padding during evaluation
- coordinates are normalized to `[0, 999]`, but scoring is still performed in original image pixels after de-normalization

## Current Branch Status

This `protocol-v2` branch intentionally diverges from the older DSL-based protocol. In particular:

- no task-specific protocol token expansion
- no tokenizer resize for arrow protocol markers
- no special-token state-machine decoding
- JSON-based supervision and decoding instead

Old checkpoints trained with the previous DSL protocol should be treated as incompatible with this branch’s task format.
